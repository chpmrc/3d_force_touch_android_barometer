# 3D Force Touch on Android

Just a (**very**) quick and dirty example of how it is possible to simulate 3D Force Touch on Android using the barometer.

I made this in 10-15 minutes so the quality of the code is really bad. It is just a proof of concept.

I used this plugin for Cordova: https://github.com/zanderso/cordova-plugin-barometer .
